# UFCG_alignments

**UFCG concatenated alignment files for Cryptocalciella**

This repository contains fasta and nexus alignment files that were used to infer the phylogenomic position of Cryptocalciella humilis. The files were prepared with the used of Universal Fungal Core Genes Pipeline and contain the alignment for all 61 molecular markers and ITS sequences extracted from publicly available Mortierellaceae genomes. Names of strains comply with names on the phylogenomic tree leaves specified in the Supplementary metrials of the study.
